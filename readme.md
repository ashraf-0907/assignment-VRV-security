# Bill Management System for Cloud Kitchens
## Overview
This project is a Bill Management System tailored for cloud kitchens. It enables businesses to manage bills, analyze profits and losses, and streamline operations through well-defined user roles and robust API integrations.

### Project Structure
The project is designed with a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. Below is an overview of the key components:

1. Main Server
Purpose: Acts as the central server managing all API requests and route definitions.
Responsibilities:
Hosts the main application logic.
Defines RESTful APIs for bill management and user operations.
Manages authentication and authorization through middleware.
Notable API:
addTeammember: Implements both authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
Key Features:
Centralized entry point for all requests.
Modular route handling for scalability.
2. Common-Model
Purpose: A shared SDK/package (similar to npm packages) that defines models used across the system.
Responsibilities:
Provides consistent and reusable models for both frontend and backend.
Promotes code reusability and ensures uniformity in data structures.
Benefits:
Avoids duplicating model definitions between the frontend and backend.
Acts as a single source of truth for business logic related to data modeling.
3. Server-Components
Purpose: An SDK that handles database interactions and external server calls.
Responsibilities:
Manages database queries and updates.
Facilitates calls to other servers (e.g., for analytics).
Serves as a shared layer for database operations to ensure consistency.
Key Benefits:
Centralized database logic for easy reuse.
Prepares for future expansion (e.g., an analytics server) by providing reusable APIs.
### System Theme
The Bill Management System focuses on providing tools for cloud kitchen operators to:
Efficiently manage bills.
Assign and control access for team members.
Gain insights into their business performance through analytics.
### User Roles and Permissions
1. Admin
Full access to all APIs.
Can add and manage team members, bills, and business operations.
2. Cook
Access limited to their assigned responsibilities.
More privileges than a Delivery Boy but fewer than an Admin.
3. Delivery Boy
Restricted to editing bills only.
Cannot access sensitive business or team management features.

### Key API Example: addTeammember
Endpoint
Path: /addTeammember
Description: Adds a new team member to a business.
Implementation:
Authentication:
Handled through middleware to validate the user's identity.
Authorization:
Managed by teammemberPermissions to ensure only users with the necessary permissions can add team members.

### Permissions Handling
teammemberPermissions defines:
What actions a particular role (Admin, Cook, Delivery Boy) can perform.
How these permissions vary for different businesses.
Scalability and Future Enhancements

### Why This Structure?


#### Main Server:

Serves as a centralized hub for managing routes and APIs.
Easily extendable for future features.


#### Common-Model:

Shared models ensure consistency across the frontend and backend.
Avoids duplication of logic, reducing maintenance overhead.


#### Server-Components:

Centralized database logic is essential for scalability.
Prepares the system for additional servers (e.g., an analytics server).
### Planned Enhancements:

#### Analytics Integration:
Leverage server-components for shared database queries.
Introduce advanced reporting tools for business insights.

#### Enhanced RBAC:
More granular permissions for custom roles.
Dynamic role assignments.
Important Aspects to Highlight
1. Modular Design
Separates concerns (API handling, model definitions, database operations) to ensure scalability and maintainability.
2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Strong RBAC implementation ensures:
Only authorized users can perform specific actions.
Secure management of sensitive operations like adding team members.
3. Shared Components
Common-Model and Server-Components:
Ensure consistency and reusability across the system.
Simplify future development by centralizing logic.
4. Multi-Business Support
A single user can manage multiple businesses and team members.
Scales efficiently for users with multiple cloud kitchen locations.

Use tools like Postman to test endpoints such as /addTeammember.
This structure ensures a scalable, maintainable, and efficient bill management system tailored for cloud kitchen businesses.
